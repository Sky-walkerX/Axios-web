# Assignment: My Introduction Page (HTML Only)

Now that you know the basics of HTML, it’s time to create your **first personal web page**.

---

## Task
Make a web page that introduces **yourself** using only HTML.

---

## Requirements

#### **Create a HTML Page**
   - **name**.
   - **introduction**.
   - An image of yourself (or any placeholder image if you don’t want to share your photo).
   - Your **branch** (e.g., Computer Science, Information Technology, etc.)
   - Your **roll number**
   - Your **hobbies** (you can create a list)
   - A fun fact about yourself written inside a separate paragraph. (try to use text formatting tags like <strong>, <em> etc, for this paragraph)

P.S. These are only suggestions. You can use as many tags as you like and make the page as complex as you want. For now, stick to HTML, we’ll add CSS later.

---
Save your file as `[roll_number].html`.
